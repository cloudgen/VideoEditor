**Status**: Active (Version 1.1.2)
**Area**: python
**Key**: `requirement-python-coding-style`
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

Define Python coding style and defensive file I/O conventions for VideoJoin: how agents and maintainers write Python so path, temp, and publish behavior stays safe across mounts, including USB, without duplicating domain or FFmpeg pipeline tables.

Pipeline-specific application of these rules is owned by `requirement-video-ffmpeg-pipeline`. The class map is owned by `requirement-python-oop`. The logger construct is owned by `requirement-python-cli-logging`.

### 1.1 Human-facing

**In one sentence:** A finished join is moved into place with `shutil.move`, and the classes that do the work live in the files the class map names.

| Box | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| You / this login | Maintainer changing the join or the menu | Keep the publish call as `shutil.move`. Put new behavior on the class that owns that job |
| The other role | The class map and the status logger | `requirement-python-oop`, `requirement-python-cli-logging` |
| Not this file | The menu picture and the concat filter graph | TUI and pipeline requirements |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| `shutil.move` as the publish call. Temps beside the destination when that folder is writable | Bare `os.rename` as the only publish when the mounts differ |
| The class map as the allowed end state | Treating the procedural pile in `cli.py` as the allowed end state |
| Package import that does not construct ChronicleLogger | Re-exporting ChronicleLogger, or a factory whose job is to build a mapped class |

| Surface | What you open | What for |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `src/VideoEditor/cli.py` | Running session today. `Cli` and `def main` in the end state | Entry |
| Class files named by `requirement-python-oop` | One class each, when an implement order lands them | The jobs that `cli.py` still holds |
| Publish helper | `shutil.move` | Move the finished temp to the output name |

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Publish the finished file | Call `shutil.move`. Log that publish before the call, once the logger exists. | The join output name |
| Add a behavior | Put it on the class in the map. Do not add a module-level function beside that class. | Edit that class file |
| Import VideoJoin | The import succeeds even when you only need `__version__`. It does not construct the logger. | `python -c "import VideoEditor"` |

## 2. Core Rules (Mandatory)

### 2.1 General style (this product)

1. **MUST** keep the installable package under `src/VideoEditor/` with the module entry (`__main__` / console script → `cli.main`).
2. **MUST** cite only live `docs/requirements/requirement-*.md` keys in product-source law comments.
3. **SHOULD** use a clear General Purpose docstring on each public method.
4. **MUST** fail closed with a user-visible message on expected errors (missing FFmpeg, fewer than two videos, failed join).
5. Importing the VideoJoin package **MUST NOT** construct ChronicleLogger. The construct stays inside `def main` (`requirement-python-cli-logging`). **MUST NOT** re-export `ChronicleLogger`.
6. The allowed end state is the class map in `requirement-python-oop`. The running tree is still the procedural session in `cli.py`, and that tree stays legal until an implement order lands the map. **MUST NOT** treat the procedural pile as the allowed end state. **MUST NOT** order a StateLogic + `Attr` rewrite. This file does not move the code.
6a. The site that needs an object **MUST** write `ClassName(...)`. A function or a method whose job is to instantiate a class in that map is forbidden.

### 2.2 Temporary files

7. When the final destination path is known, **MUST** prefer creating intermediate files on the same filesystem or mount as that destination (a writable parent of the final path).
8. **MUST NOT** assume system `TMPDIR` or `/tmp` is the same mount as the user’s media (USB, network, secondary disks).
9. **MUST** clean intermediate temps on success and on failure (best-effort).
10. **MUST NOT** use a fixed predictable cwd name (for example a bare `filelist.txt`) as the sole concat-list path when a unique temp can be created.

### 2.3 Publishing / moving completed files (sacred)

11. To move or publish a completed intermediate file from a temporary path to its final path, **MUST** use `shutil.move` (or a thin wrapper whose only move implementation is `shutil.move`).
12. **MUST NOT** use bare `os.replace`, `os.rename`, `pathlib.Path.replace`, or `pathlib.Path.rename` alone as the sole publish mechanism when source and destination may be on different mounts.
13. **MAY** still use same-filesystem rename semantics inside what `shutil.move` performs. Do not reimplement a fragile bare rename as product publish.
14. `shutil.copy2`, `copy`, and `copyfile` copy only. If one is used, **MUST** define whether the source is kept or deleted. A copy is not a complete move by itself.
15. FFmpeg **MAY** write the final path directly when no intermediate publish step exists. When an intermediate is used, publish **MUST** go through `shutil.move` (or the thin wrapper).

Log the temp write, the publish, and the discard of an unfinished temp before the operation (`requirement-python-cli-logging`). Those lines do not replace rules 7–15.

### 2.4 Corresponding commands / APIs (reference)

| Intent | Prefer | Avoid as sole cross-mount publish |
|--------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Move or publish a file | `shutil.move(src, dst)` | bare `os.replace`, `os.rename` |
| pathlib-oriented move | `Path` args + `shutil.move` | bare `Path.replace`, `Path.rename` across mounts |
| Copy and keep the source | `shutil.copy2` | treating a copy as a move without an unlink policy |
| Same-filesystem atomic finish | OK via the `shutil.move` rename path | assuming all mounts are identical |

### 2.5 Implementation Notes (this project)

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Package** | `VideoJoin` |
| **Running modules** | `src/VideoEditor/cli.py`, `__main__.py`, `__init__.py` |
| **End-state modules** | Named by `requirement-python-oop`. Not on disk yet |
| **Staging helpers** | `staging_dir_for`, `make_temp_path` (methods of `Join` in the end state) |
| **Publish helper** | `shutil.move` |
| **Ops apply** | `requirement-video-ffmpeg-pipeline` |
| **Gate checklist (cite ID)** | `CL-PYTHON-SHUTIL-MOVE-PUBLISH` — run when auditing promote and staging publish paths |
| **Architecture** | Running tree is procedural. Allowed end state is the class map. StateLogic + `Attr` stays unordered |
| **Logger** | Package import does not construct ChronicleLogger |
| **Version** | `1.0.5` |
| **User docs** | Root `README.md` Features must not claim a Cython-required runtime or a fixed `filelist.txt`-only strategy |

### 2.6 Why This Requirement Exists (CIAO)

- **Principle 1 – Caution**: Mount mismatches are designed for.
- **Principle 3 – Anti-fragile**: A USB destination and a system disk both publish through `shutil.move`.
- **Principle 5 – SSOT**: This file owns move and temp rules. The class map lives in its own requirement.
- **Principle 11 – Temps**: Staging and cleanup are explicit.

## Under command line for normal user only

On Termux, Git Bash, Windows cmd, or the same class, temps and the published file stay in the normal user’s folders. **This requirement:** do not use administrator privilege, `sudo`, `apt`, or a dedicated system user to publish a join or to construct a class. Do not pipe a downloaded script into a shell. Type 1 and Type 2 are unused on Termux, Git Bash, and Windows cmd. Git Bash and Windows cmd do not call Termux `pkg`.

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution:** Do not assume one filesystem.
- **Intentional:** `shutil.move` is the named publish API. The class map is the named end state.
- **Anti-fragile:** Temps on the destination mount avoid a full-file copy when the mount allows it.
- **Over-protect:** Do not bring back a bare cross-device rename as the only publish.

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants, Grok, or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Replace `shutil.move` publish with bare `os.replace` or `os.rename` for simplicity.
2. Stage every large intermediate only under the system temp when the final destination is known on another mount.
3. Cite a template or a skill from product source as behavioral authority.
4. Treat the procedural session in `cli.py` as the allowed end state. Do not start the class split inside a style-only edit. Do not order a StateLogic rewrite.
5. Store secrets in style docs or in code.
6. Reintroduce a fixed-name cwd `filelist.txt` as the only concat-list strategy.
7. Construct ChronicleLogger at import time, or add a factory whose job is to instantiate a mapped class.

**Violating this rule is a critical regression.**

## 5. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| AC-1 | Publish of intermediates uses `shutil.move` (or a thin wrapper) |
| AC-2 | A bare cross-mount rename is forbidden as the sole publish |
| AC-3 | Same-filesystem staging is preferred when the destination is known |
| AC-4 | The pipeline requirement remains the concat SSOT |
| AC-5 | Registered in the index |
| AC-6 | Package import does not construct ChronicleLogger and does not re-export it |
| AC-7 | A promote-path audit uses `CL-PYTHON-SHUTIL-MOVE-PUBLISH` when ship publish code changes |
| AC-8 | The allowed end state points at `requirement-python-oop`. StateLogic stays unordered |
